<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="muted">Last updated: <script>document.write(new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10))</script></p>

<h2>1) Service</h2>
<p>BoostBridgeDIY is a <b>personal-use</b> tool that helps you draft dispute letters from your own inputs. It is <b>not legal advice</b> and <b>not a credit-repair service</b>. You are solely responsible for your use and outcomes.</p>

<h2>2) Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
<p>You must be 18+ and provide accurate information. Do not share your login or use another person’s identity.</p>

<h2>3) Acceptable Use</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use only for your own credit file.</li>
  <li>No scraping, reverse engineering, or automated abuse.</li>
  <li>No unlawful, deceptive, or fraudulent activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4) Plans, Credits & Payments</h2>
<p>Plans may include daily/monthly credit limits. Credits are non-transferable and reset per plan rules. Payments are processed by our payment provider (e.g., Stripe). By subscribing, you authorize recurring charges until you cancel (see Refunds & Cancellation).</p>

<h2>5) Generated Content</h2>
<p>You may download letters for your personal use. We may log minimal metadata (e.g., counts) to enforce quotas and improve reliability.</p>

<h2>6) Disclaimers</h2>
<p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not guarantee any credit outcome.</p>

<h2>7) Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, our total liability for any claim related to the Service will not exceed the amount you paid in the 3 months prior to the claim.</p>

<h2>8) Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising from your misuse of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

<h2>9) Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate access for violations, abuse, or unpaid charges.</p>

<h2>10) Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of your U.S. state of residence (or, if outside the U.S., the State of Florida), excluding conflict-of-law rules.</p>

<h2>11) Changes</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms. We’ll post the new date above.</p>
